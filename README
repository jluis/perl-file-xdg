    specification

SYNOPSIS

     use File::XDG;
    
     my $xdg = File::XDG->new(name => 'foo');
    
     # user config
     $xdg->config_home
    
     # user data
     $xdg->data_home
    
     # user cache
     $xdg->cache_home
    
     # system config
     $xdg->config_dirs
    
     # system data
     $xdg->data_dirs

DESCRIPTION

    This module provides a basic implementation of the XDG base directory
    specification as exists by the Free Desktop Organization (FDO). It
    supports all XDG directories except for the runtime directories, which
    require session management support in order to function.

CONSTRUCTOR

 $xdg = File::XDG->new( %args )

    Returns a new instance of a File::XDG object. This must be called with
    an application name as the name argument.

    Takes the following named arguments:

    name => STRING

      Name of the application for which File::XDG is being used.

METHODS

 $xdg->data_home()

    Returns the user-specific data directory for the application as a
    Path::Class object.

 $xdg->config_home()

    Returns the user-specific configuration directory for the application
    as a Path::Class object.

 $xdg->cache_home()

    Returns the user-specific cache directory for the application as a
    Path::Class object.

 $xdg->data_dirs()

    Returns the system data directories, not modified for the application.
    Per the specification, the returned string is :-delimited.

 $xdg->config_dirs()

    Returns the system config directories, not modified for the
    application. Per the specification, the returned string is :-delimited.

 $xdg->lookup_data_file('subdir', 'filename');

    Looks up the data file by searching for ./subdir/filename relative to
    all base directories indicated by $XDG_DATA_HOME and $XDG_DATA_DIRS. If
    an environment variable is either not set or empty, its default value
    as defined by the specification is used instead. Returns a Path::Class
    object.

 $xdg->lookup_config_file('subdir', 'filename');

    Looks up the configuration file by searching for ./subdir/filename
    relative to all base directories indicated by $XDG_CONFIG_HOME and
    $XDG_CONFIG_DIRS. If an environment variable is either not set or
    empty, its default value as defined by the specification is used
    instead. Returns a Path::Class object.

ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS

    This module's Windows support is made possible by File::HomeDir. I
    would also like to thank Path::Class and File::Spec.
